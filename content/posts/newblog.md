### What are the older posts?
You may notice that posts have been written before this one. I have ported my posts from **Medium**, as I greatly prefer the customizability and more professional manner of a blog using a static site generator, and I get to write posts in **Markdown** as well.

My previous posts consider _reverse engineering minesweeper_ for a end-product of forcing every cell in a board to contain a mine. If that sounds interesting, check it out.

### What is this blog about?
I mainly plan on posting whatever is of interest to me, but expect **graphics programming** and **C++** related posts for the near future.
